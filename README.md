# Mobile OTP verification sample using Django

## Here We are going to see how can send Mobile OTP using django.
  - ### Requirements - Yoou need to have API key from any sms provider. There are many sms providers out there in market such as **Twillio, Fast2sms, Msg91, Telesign** etc
  - Here I've used <ins>Fast2sms</ins> API to test my codebase. You can use any other one as per your requirements. You just need to follow their documentation to integrate their API in your codebase.
  - How to run the code?
      - Download the code in zip format. Unzip it at specified location.
      - activate the virutal environment using **py venv\scripts\activate
      - install the required dependencies using pip such as *django, djangorestframework etc*
      - test using Postman or browser at localhhost.
      - That's it.
  - Note - I did not create any requirements.txt file for handlinng depedencies.
